"Well, Mr. Donahue, I think that’s all we have to ask you. Now it’s your turn to do the speaking! Do you have any questions you’d like to ask us about the job?
Well, yes there are few things. For example, you asked me earlier if I had any project management experience. Does that mean that you’re looking for people with this kind of experience?
Oh, not necessarily, although clearly it would be an advantage. But no, what we’re looking for is the potential for leadership. Obviously the most important skills for the current job are the necessary computer programming expertise, but if we think someone has the necessary skills set for a leadership role in the future-things like organizational and communication skills, then we’re interested.

"Now we’ve got your camera connected directly to the projector, so we actually don’t need to copy the photos onto the computer at all. You can project directly from your camera!
Oh, that’s great. It’s just that I have no idea at all how to use the projector.
Don’t worry. It’s really very easy. First of all, use the red button here to switch it on and off. The green button puts the projector on standby, which is very convenient for presentations. These blue arrows here control the color and the brightness of the image and then there’s this little wheel here. If you turn the wheel towards you, the image gets bigger, and if you turn it away from you, the image gets smaller.

Well, anyway we don’t have that particular part in stock and we have to order a new one.
Oh? Well just go ahead and order one. What’s the problem exactly? Don’t you have the catalogue?
No, that’s not a problem. It’s just that last week Mr. Logan, my supervisor, told me not to order anything without asking him first…. and he’s not here today.
